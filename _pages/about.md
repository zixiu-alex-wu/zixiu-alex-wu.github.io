I am currently a third-year Marie-Curie PhD candidate of the [PhilHumans project](https://www.philhumans.eu/) at Philips Research, supervised by Dr. [Rim Helaoui](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/rim-helaoui-86008423), Prof. [Diego Reforgiato Recupero](https://aibd.unica.it/people/diego-reforgiato), and Prof. [Daniele Riboni](https://aibd.unica.it/people/daniele-riboni). My research mainly focuses on developing therapy-inspired natural language processing technologies, such as dialogue AI with empathy.

Before starting my PhD, I finished my MSc degree in Advanced Computing with disctinction at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. Lucia Specia. I obtained my joint degree of BSc in Computer Science and BEng in Software Engineering from the University of Birmingham and Sun Yat-sen University, respectively.
